# Bug Fixes Summary

This document outlines all the fixes implemented to address the reported issues in the Legal AI Chatbot application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ File Upload - Expanded Format Support
**Issue:** Only JPEG and PNG files were accepted for upload

**Solution:**
- **File:** `app/(chat)/api/files/upload/route.ts`
- Added support for PDF, DOC, DOCX, and WebP formats
- Implemented separate size limits:
  - Images (JPEG, PNG, WebP): 5MB max
  - Documents (PDF, DOC, DOCX): 10MB max
- Added comprehensive file type validation with clear error messages
- Improved filename sanitization to prevent upload issues

**Supported Formats Now:**
- Images: JPEG, PNG, WebP
- Documents: PDF, DOC, DOCX

---

### 2. ✅ Drag & Drop File Upload
**Issue:** No drag and drop functionality - only file picker button

**Solution:**
- **File:** `components/multimodal-input.tsx`
- Implemented complete drag & drop handlers:
  - `onDragEnter` - Activates drop zone
  - `onDragLeave` - Deactivates drop zone
  - `onDragOver` - Prevents default behavior
  - `onDrop` - Processes dropped files
- Added visual feedback during drag operation:
  - Border highlight with dashed style
  - Backdrop with file type information
  - Clear instructions for users
- Unified file processing logic for both drag-drop and file picker

---

### 3. ✅ Upload Error Handling
**Issue:** Generic error messages, difficult to debug

**Solution:**
- **File:** `app/(chat)/api/files/upload/route.ts`
- Enhanced error messages with specific details:
  - Authentication errors: "Unauthorized. Please sign in to upload files."
  - No file provided: "No file provided. Please select a file to upload."
  - File size errors: "File size too large. Images: max 5MB, Documents: max 10MB"
  - Type errors: "File type not supported. Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP, PDF, DOC, DOCX"
  - Network errors: "Upload failed. Please check your internet connection and try again."
- Added console logging for debugging
- Implemented proper error propagation

---

### 4. ✅ Image/Document Preview Visibility
**Issue:** Image previews not showing properly after upload

**Solution:**
- **File:** `components/preview-attachment.tsx`
- Added error handling for failed image loads
- Implemented distinct file type icons:
  - PDF files: Red-themed icon with "PDF" label
  - DOC files: Blue-themed icon with "DOC" label
  - Generic files: Default file icon
- Fixed CSS gradient issue (`bg-linear-to-t` → `bg-gradient-to-t`)
- Added `flex-shrink-0` to prevent preview squashing
- Improved filename display with proper truncation

---

### 5. ✅ Authentication Error Handling
**Issue:** Basic toast notifications, not enough detail

**Solution:**
- **Files:** 
  - `app/(auth)/register/page.tsx`
  - `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`

**Register Page:**
- User exists: "An account with this email already exists. Please sign in instead."
- Failed: "Failed to create account. Please check your connection and try again."
- Invalid data: "Please provide a valid email address and password (minimum 8 characters)."
- Success: "Account created successfully! Welcome!"

**Login Page:**
- Failed: "Invalid email or password. Please check your credentials and try again."
- Invalid data: "Please provide a valid email address and password."
- Success: "Signed in successfully! Welcome back!"

---

### 6. ✅ Model Selection Error Handling
**Issue:** 404 errors after selecting AI model

**Solution:**
- **File:** `components/model-selector.tsx`
- Added try-catch error handling in model selection
- Implemented fallback to first available model if selected model not found
- Added error toast notification on save failure
- Implemented optimistic update with rollback on error
- Enhanced error logging for debugging

---

### 7. ✅ Incomplete AI Responses
**Issue:** AI responses stopping midway through answers

**Solution:**
- **File:** `app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts`
- Increased step count limit from 5 to 10 (`stopWhen: stepCountIs(10)`)
- Added logging for response truncation detection
- Enhanced error handling in stream processing
- Improved error messages for stream failures:
  - Generic error: "An error occurred while generating the response. Please try again."
- Added console warnings for debugging truncated responses

---

## Testing Recommendations

### File Upload Testing
1. Test uploading each supported file type (JPEG, PNG, WebP, PDF, DOC, DOCX)
2. Test file size limits (try files over 5MB for images, over 10MB for documents)
3. Test unsupported file types (should show clear error)
4. Test drag & drop functionality
5. Verify preview visibility for all file types

### Authentication Testing
1. Test sign-up with existing email
2. Test sign-up with invalid email format
3. Test sign-up with short password
4. Test sign-in with wrong credentials
5. Test sign-in with correct credentials
6. Verify all error messages are clear and actionable

### Model Selection Testing
1. Test switching between different AI models
2. Test with network disconnection during model change
3. Verify model persists after page refresh
4. Test fallback behavior if model unavailable

### AI Response Testing
1. Test with long, complex legal questions
2. Verify responses complete fully
3. Test with multiple back-and-forth messages
4. Monitor console for any truncation warnings

### 8. ✅ PDF and Image Content Processing
**Issue:** PDF and image files were uploaded but their content was not extracted/analyzed for AI context

**Solution:**
- **Files:** 
  - `lib/files/processor.ts` - Main file processing coordinator
  - `lib/files/pdf-extractor.ts` - PDF text extraction
  - `lib/files/image-analyzer.ts` - Image analysis using Gemini vision model
  - `lib/files/cache-manager.ts` - Database caching for processed files
  - `lib/files/types.ts` - Type definitions
  - `lib/db/schema.ts` - Database schema for ProcessedFile table
  - `lib/db/migrations/0003_add_processed_file_table.sql` - Migration file
  - `lib/ai/providers.ts` - Added Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model
  - `app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts` - Integrated file processing

**Implementation Details:**

**PDF Processing:**
- Uses `pdf-parse` library to extract text from PDF files
- Extracts all text content from PDF pages
- Stores page count and file size in metadata
- Handles extraction errors gracefully with detailed error messages

**Image Analysis:**
- Uses Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview model for vision analysis
- Analyzes images to describe:
  - Objects, people, and scenes
  - Any text visible in the image
  - Important visual elements
- Converts analysis to text context for AI

**Caching System:**
- Generates SHA-256 hash of file content for deduplication
- Stores processed results in PostgreSQL database
- Cache expires after 7 days to save storage
- Prevents reprocessing of same files
- Improves performance and reduces API costs

**Integration:**
- Automatically processes PDF and image files when attached to messages
- Extracts/analyzes content before sending to AI
- Adds extracted content as additional text context
- Works seamlessly with existing chat flow
- Handles errors without disrupting chat functionality

**Supported Processing:**
- PDF files: Full text extraction
- Images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP): AI vision analysis
